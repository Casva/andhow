AndHow!  strong.simple.valid.AppConfiguration
======
A strongly typed configuration framework with detailed validation that is simple to use
for web apps, command line or any application environment.

Key Features
--------------
Strong Typing **&** Detailed validation **&** Simple to use **&** Fails Fast **&** Self Documenting
Complete Usage Example
--------------
```java
import yarnandtail.andhow.property.*;
import yarnandtail.andhow.*;
import yarnandtail.andhow.load.PropFileLoader;

public class SimpleSample {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		AndHow.builder() /* 1) Simple builder initializes framework */
				.loader(new SysPropLoader())
				.loader(new JndiLoader())
				.loader(new PropFileLoader())
				.group(MySetOfProps.class) /* 2) MySetOfProps defined below */
				.build();
	
		//3) After initialization, Properties can be used to directly access their values.
		//Note the strongly typed return values.
		String queryUrl =
				MySetOfProps.SERVICE_URL.getValue() +
				MySetOfProps.QUERY_ENDPOINT.getValue();
		Integer timeout = MySetOfProps.TIMEOUT.getValue();
		
		System.out.println("The query url is: " + queryUrl);
		System.out.println("Timeout is : " + timeout);
	}
	
	//4) Normally PropertyGroups would be in separate files with the module they apply to
	@GroupInfo(name="Example Property group", desc="One logical set of properties")
	public interface MySetOfProps extends PropertyGroup {
		
		StrProp SERVICE_URL = StrProp.builder().mustEndWith("/").build();
		IntProp TIMEOUT = IntProp.builder().defaultValue(50).build();
		StrProp QUERY_ENDPOINT = StrProp.builder().required()
				.desc("Service name added to end of url for the queries").build();
	}
}
```
### Walking through the example:
1.	`AndHow` initializes with a simple builder().  _Loaders_ read properties from
	various sources.  You can determine the order of the loaders - in this example,
	properties found in System.properties take precedence over values found in
	the JNDI context, and so on.  Several other loaders are available, including command line. 
2.	Configuration properties are explicitly declared in groups to keep
	related properties together, then groups are added to the AndHow instance.
3.	`Property` values can be accessed directly from the Property itself - there is
	no _magic name string_ to fetch properties from a HashMap.
	Return values of `getValue()` are _**strongly typed**_.
4.	Properties are declared just like Java constants - In fact, they _are_ Java
	constants.  AndHow takes advantage of the fact that fields declared in
	interfaces are implicitly `public static final` and the `PropertyGroup` interface
	is the base for all sets of `Properties`.
	PropertyGroups are self-describing just by the name you choose for them, but
	you can also include descriptive annotations.
	Properties describe themselves in their builders, 
	including the value type (String, Integer, etc), required vs. optional,
	validation rules and description.

Of course, this example fails because there is no _andhow.properties_ file.
This is a good thing - you would not want a miss-configured application to appear to start.
Even better, it doesn't just fail, it prints a sample configuration for each
of the loaders in use.  For the PropFileLoader it would print this:

```properties
##########################################################################################
# Sample properties file generated by AndHow!  strong.simple.valid.App_Configuration  ####
##################################################  https://github.com/eeverman/andhow ###
# Property Group 'Example Property group' - One logical set of properties
# Defined in interface org.simple.SimpleSample.MySetOfProps

# SERVICE_URL (String) 
# The configured value must end with '/'
org.simple.SimpleSample.MySetOfProps.SERVICE_URL = [String]

# TIMEOUT (Integer) 
# Default Value: 50
org.simple.SimpleSample.MySetOfProps.TIMEOUT = 50

# QUERY_ENDPOINT (String) REQUIRED - Service name added to end of url for the queries
org.simple.SimpleSample.MySetOfProps.QUERY_ENDPOINT = [String]
##########################################################################################
